RESUME
Sean Baker
Leveraging a strong background in technology with a specific passion for coding, I enjoy growing and building as a software developer. I originally got a 2 year degree and couldn’t afford to go longer at the time. After making my way through many small businesses I decided I was done with small office politics. And went back to school where I am currently maintaining a 3.91 GPA after 3 Semesters.  My enthusiasm for building relationships and unwavering commitment to continuous learning empower me to address complex technical challenges effectively, transforming them into innovative strategies. This adaptability to the dynamic nature of consulting positions me to significantly improve client satisfaction and advance the development of cloud solutions. Moreover, my ability to foster meaningful connections ensures successful partnerships and enduring client relationships.

Summary
I am an experienced software engineer with a proven track record in various industries. My expertise spans from low-level C and C++ programming to Java web development and cloud architecture. Currently, I am pursuing dual degrees in Computer Engineering and Computer Science at Old Dominion University. My passion for these fields propels me towards innovation in technology, and my academic achievements have earned me a spot on the Dean's List, reflecting my dedication to excellence.
Most recently, I contributed to the development of an NCAA-sponsored eLearning platform at fieldXperience. In this role, I integrated Brightspace using OAuth and SAML 2.0, showcasing my competencies in cloud computing server management and software development. Before that, I worked on low-level C code for custom-made FPGAs used in manufacturing automation. This experience taught me how to design every library from scratch, including the library that handled the TCP/IP stack, enabling us to process millions of packets per second and communicate with the PLCs.
I am familiar with Intel's Quartus, VHDL, C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript, and I have partially learned Prolog, Fortran, and even Forth. I am obsessed with speed in my code and constantly compare different compilers, such as Google's LLVM for vectors, using tools like Compiler Explorer to see how different compilers convert C++ into assembly.
My commitment is to leverage my educational background and software development skills to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry. Much of modern development focuses on maintenance, and speed is paramount. My strengths lie in my strong communication and interpersonal skills, which enable me to effectively bring people together. However, I have no desire to be just a cog in the AI machinery. I am passionate about CppCon and enjoy the history of programming languages, appreciating how many problems were solved long before most modern-day languages themselves were invented, like substring searches aka Knuth-Morris-Pratt Boyer-Moore Algorithm.

•	Despite this the companys IP had incredible value and was installed in Die Cast factories all over the world. The original software developer had built everything from scratch using no libraries but the windows library when he needed to. This allowed his software to be faster than most things ive ever seen, allowing him to capture 100,000’s of datapoints in milliseconds. 
•	Oversaw project upgrading from Cyclone 2 processor on FPGA to Cyclone IV.
•	Studied Mechanical and Electrical Engineering to familiarize myself with the project and company completely
•	Updated Windows Mail Slots to Windows Sockets for Inter-Process Communication.
o	System Analysis and Planning: Conducted a thorough analysis of the existing Mail Slot implementation, identifying performance bottlenecks and security vulnerabilities.
o	Design and Development: Designed and implemented a new communication architecture using Windows Sockets (Winsock), ensuring robust and secure data exchange.
o	Integration and Testing: Integrated the new socket-based communication system into existing applications. Performed extensive testing to validate functionality, performance, and security.
•	Stopped wasted resources on a 5-year outsourced Python project that could not handle the throughput. Several items in the BOM failed to meet distribution standards.
•	Implemented several specific requirements for companies like Mercury Marine, Honda of Canada, and Walker Die Casting.
